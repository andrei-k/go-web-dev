# Web Development with Go

Personal playground where I'll experimenting with various concepts and small projects related to web development using the Go language.

## Notes

In VSCode, open the Command Palette and type: "Go: Install/Update Tools"<br>
Select all checkboxes and click OK

If the installation fails with an error like this: "xcrun: error: invalid active developer path..."

Install XCode Command Line by running this command in the Terminal:

```
xcode-select --install
```
