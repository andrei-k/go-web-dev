# Full Stack Starter 

A simple web app that includes a back end written in Go and front end in HTML and Javascript. The idea is that the front end is fully decoupled from the back end. In this example, Go doesn't render the template. The back end only contains functions that can be called from the front end.

## Usage

Start the back end server

```
cd backend
go run .
```

Then, open `/frontend/index.html` in your browser.  

The back end will be accessible through: http://localhost:8080/
